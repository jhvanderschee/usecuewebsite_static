<p>What is the ‘Speed index’ in your portfolio exactly, you ask? The short answer is: it is the time a website needs to fully load.</p>

<p>As you can see these values vary from one to several seconds. That is remarkably slow. Especially considering that I can <a href="/blog/websites-that-load-instantly">make websites load instantly</a>. So what is up with this speed index? Why is it so high? This value comes from the <a href="/blog/google-lighthouse-score/">Google Lighthouse</a> performance audit and is calculated by simulating a slow 3G connection. A website with a speed index of two seconds will load significantly faster on a desktop computer or a fast mobile connection. Google uses this speed index to rank websites. Google <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-search.html?m=1">prefers</a> fast loading websites, so lower is better. Websites with a low speed index rank higher. By chosing for a slow 3G connection as the standard Google emphasizes the importance of a low ‘Page weight’, as a small page is delivered significantly faster over such a narrow connection.</p>

<p>So… a well-coded website should have the lowest page weight possible. This will result in a significantly lower speed index, which will result in a higher position in the search results. Simple, right?</p>
