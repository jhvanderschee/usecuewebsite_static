<p>No code platforms promise the content creator that he/she does not need a designer or developer.</p>

<p>We have seen very big players try this for many many years, like Adobe with Muse, Wix, WordPress with page builders and Gutenberg. What makes anyone think that the new kids, like Webflow or Squarespace are going to succeed? There is SO MUCH capital wasted on these platforms, while the output is often horrible from a developer and art director point of view. I have to admit that creating themes works on a large scale, but on a small scale it is quite expensive. We have seen that in WordPress. Visual editing obviously works too. However, good ‘no code’ solutions do not exist. Let’s take Gutenberg for example. It loads a 40kb blocking CSS in my WordPress website, while it can only create a handful of different blocks. That is twice the size of my complete homepage… and remember… it is blocking and none of my own stuff has loaded yet. Wix is even worse. Their performance is extremely bad. I rebuild a Wix website and made it 10 times faster (and smaller)!! The same is true for a lot of page builders in WordPress…. and this is just the technical perspective. Because we all know what happens when we let content creators freely influence design… Horror! Still, we keep dreaming that there is some magic solution that makes our jobs obsolete. And why? Creating low quality stuff without designers and developers is an option… OK, I get it… It is the reason Google AMP exists… Can we now please move on?</p>

<p>Note that I have my fair share of experience with no-code platforms. I have built and own https://withoutcoding.com/. A platform for designers where they can build digital productions (like magazines and landing pages). The output is static HTML, so it is basically an SSG. No-code platforms work for designers that do not know how to (or want to) hand-off a final design. However, I have not met a lot of professional designers that actually want to build their own websites on a no-code platform. Most designer only want to do what they are really good at: design. They want to out-source the coding part. I get that and it is also smart from a business point of view. As a designer you just need to know a good developer… So my advice to you is: invest in relations with designers. It pays off. Designers rather have you (a developer) build their website then them doing it on a no-code platform…. which makes no-code platforms a tool for developers. I think Webflow could be just that: a tool for (inexperienced) developers. Although I think that it might be smarter for developers to learn HTML and CSS than to learn how to work with Webflow, but hey… that is just from an experienced developers point-of-view. I think that code will always beat no-code for (experienced) developers. To illustrate this, I have built a website in the browser during my talk at JekyllConf2019. It included version control (git), a form builder and a CMS. I did the whole thing live in under 20 minutes. You can check it out at https://jekyllconf.com/. Can those development times be beaten with browser-based no-code tools like Webflow? I think not.</p>
