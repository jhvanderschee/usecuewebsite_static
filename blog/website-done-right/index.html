<p>Take a good look at this aggressive blue color. Does it remind you of <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Klein">Yves Klein</a>? It is the native color of an unstyled HTML link. The exact color is #0000ee and is worth <a href="https://www.widewalls.ch/yves-klein-paintings-top-auction/ikb-1/">17 million dollar</a>.</p>

<p>Does the font look familiar too? You are right… that is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman">famous default serif</a> of the web. You may have even noticed that all links are underlined, like they naturally are in HTML. So why did I make this? I wanted to create a tribute to the web.</p>

<p>Unfortunately most web developers fight the web. The avarage (<a href="https://www.igvita.com/2016/01/12/the-average-page-is-a-myth/">median</a>) page load is <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight">almost 2Mb and still growing</a>. And to make matters worse, web developers have even became incapable of solving their self created problems. A clear example is AMP from Google, which became a popular solution for lightweight mobile pages. However, Google does not have some sort of super light HTML… nor does it have super quick servers (seriously… they are even kind of slow). They just know how to build a proper website. A skill that most web developers seem to have lost.</p>

<p>This website is meant as a statement, more than anything else. The design is honest and brutal and it weighs only 20kb. That means this fully functional web page is 10 times smaller than jQuery alone (the library most websites load to do Javascript stuff) and 100 times smaller than the average web page. This page requires only <em>three</em> web requests: an HTML file for the content, a CSS file for the layout and a JS file for some additional features. It uses a font that was already present on your machine and uses CSS to make it scale along with the screen size (with a minimum and a maximum). This fully responsive website has a 100% score for Speed, Accessibility, Performance and Best Practise in <a href="https://web.dev">Google Lighthouse</a>.</p>

<p>This website is a combination of art and craft. It respects the web. Enjoy!</p>
