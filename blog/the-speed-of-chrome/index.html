<p>In 2010 Google promised us websites that would load as quick as shooting a potato through a slicer with explosives. In other words, in one or two tenths of a second.</p>

<p>Their campaign was a big hit and Chrome turned out to be a game changer. Chrome became the most used browser world wide in no-time. Even loyal Firefox fans like myself jumped ship.</p>

<p>In this specific video they used the website allrecipes.com. I was curious to see how fast it loads today in Chrome. We could ask Lighthouse, but Lighthouse simulaties a slow 3G connection. So I asked Pingdom. Pimgdom told me that the current website of allrecipes.com loads in 3.6 seconds. So this website has either became MUCH slower in the past 9 years OR they were looking at a preloaded website in 2010.</p>

<p>With the current focus on speed, I was wondering: Can a website actually load in 0.2 seconds? The answer is a definitive YES. This website loads in 0.16 seconds. Donâ€™t believe me? Ask Pingdom. What it requires? Heavily compressed images little JavaScript and no jQuery (and a server not to far away)..</p>

<p>Do you</p>
