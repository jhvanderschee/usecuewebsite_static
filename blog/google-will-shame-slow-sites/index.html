<p>At Chrome Dev Summit Google announced that it “is looking at ways to reward developers for going the extra mile when it comes to website performance”. They shared some early explorations which surface speed signals in the Chrome’s UI, like a preloading screen, warning you for the slow experience or a colored loading bar. Google will identify sites that typically load fast or slow for users with clear badging. They say that this may take a number of forms and that they plan to experiment with different options, to determine which provides the most value to their users.</p>

<h2 id="the-ssl-approach">The SSL approach</h2>

<p>When I heard this I immediately recalled the way Google approached SSL. First they gave all secure websites a green badge and later they made the green badge gray, and actively shamed non-SSL websites by displaying ‘Not secure’ in front of their URL. Additionally they promoted SSL websites in their search results and demoted non-SSL websites. There was little we (web developers) could do, but to obey and follow Googles rules. I expect them to go for an almost identical approach here. If you have a slow website, Google will shame you.</p>

<h2 id="speed-is-very-important">Speed is very important</h2>

<p>In a blogpost the Chromium team says that “speed has been one of Chrome’s core principles since the beginning”, and that they “are constantly working to give users <a href="/blog/websites-that-load-instantly/">an experience that is instant</a> as they browse the web”. Google was VERY succesful when it introduced its new faster browser in 2008. It changed the whole browser market by improving just one thing: speed. Everybody wanted a faster internet. Without any hesitation we all switched to Chrome and Google seems to remember that very well. Adding non standard solutions to Chrome (like <a href="https://web.dev/native-lazy-loading/">lazy loading</a>) are tricks Google uses to keep that speed advantage. Speed is very important to Google.</p>

<h2 id="is-google-fixing-the-internet">Is Google fixing the internet?</h2>

<p>However, Google is also partly responsible for the decay in website speed. Google has made third-party requests the norm with services like Google fonts, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager and Google Ads. Those third party requests are not only the most important reason the internet is so terribly slow, but also the reason your privacy is so severely violated. Not Ralph, but Google broke the internet, if you really think about it.</p>

<p>However, with SSL and their focus on website performance, Google seems to be on the right track again. Promoting a safer and faster internet is a good thing. A faster internet demotes slow, privacy invading, third-party scripts, it is greener and cheaper and it makes the internet more accessible. But the question remains: What is Googles motive for doing good? Don’t be evil? Are they really trying to fix the internet and make the world better? Or is this a way to promote the their super fast, Google owned, alternative internet, called AMP? If the latter is the case, Google is the biggest threat to the (open) internet to date.</p>

<p>Either way, we have no choice… If we want our websites to perform well in Google, we will have to make them faster.</p>
